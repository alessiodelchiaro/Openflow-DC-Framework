        No aggregation for now, maybe later
    *otherwise less rules, less memory used (should read more bibliography and decided based on that
    *No backup rules are made, because of the nature of the algorithm used(algorithm for the placement of the virtual machines
    * (Yes! Keep one back up rule for each host.
