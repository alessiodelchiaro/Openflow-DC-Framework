How to use the different ERCS Modules

###
ERCS
    Main Module, used to call the other modules, including the one's that not belong to ERCS, but that ERCS takes into consideration
    
ERCS Topology
    This Module discovers the topology (switches(ERCS Switch), hosts(ERCS Host), and their links(unidirectional - which means for any link there will be two entries)). 
    Everything is handled automatically.
    TODO: Timer to after discovering all host, identify the core switches
    For more information check the class ercs_topology. In there you can see what kind of data structures were used.

ERCS Rules
    Module cable of implementing the rules in the switches (oriented to the ERCS VM algorithm).
    All the rules are saved for future usage, and can be accessed through the right variables.
    Supernetting for aggregation and core switch's is available (although not right now) 
        -when instanciating simply put Rules.SUPERNET_ON option.
    TO install the rules for one host simply call rules.installAllHostRules(...)
    TODO: Supernetting to Agg and Core switches
    For more information check the class ercs_rules. In there you can see what kind of data structures were used.
    
ERCS Stats
    Module that retrieves statistics about the switches.
    For now only port statistics are available, and due to the nature of ERCS Algorithm, only bitrate is calculated.
    Possibility for other type of statistics to be included later.
    To request Bit Rate Statistics simply call stats.requestPortStats(connection, ports, Stats.PortRequest.BIT_RATE), where
        -connection - the connection of the switch which you want statistics for
        -ports - list of port numbers belonging to the switch which you want the bit rate
        -Stats.PortRequest.BIT_RATE - type of statistics requested (for now only Bitrate available)

    To receive the statistics listen to the ercs_stats module for PortsBitRate event's. In this event it is returned the 
    statistics for the requested ports. For more detail check the PortsBitRate class on ercs_stats

ERCS Switch
    Class where all the information about any switch is kept. This includes connection, dpid, ports and type(core,agg,edge)
    For more information please check ercs_switch

ERCS Host
    Class where all the information about a host is kept. This includes id, ports, and firsttimeout.
    For more information please check ercs_host

ERCS Port
    Class where all the information about a host is kept. This includes id, mac_address, ip_addresses(list of ip addresses 
    because of virtual interfaces)
    Class used by ERCS Switch and ERCS Host
    For more information please check ercs_port
    
ERCS VMReceiver
    
    TODO: (Currently not working) try UDP instead of TCP
    TODO: Raise the event
    *currently only support ipv4 (maybe later IPv6
